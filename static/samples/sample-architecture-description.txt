# Sample Azure Web Application Architecture

## Overview
This is a sample 3-tier web application architecture deployed on Microsoft Azure, designed for high availability, scalability, and security.

## Architecture Components

### Network Layer
- **Virtual Network**: Main container (10.0.0.0/16)
  - Web Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 (hosts application services)
  - Database Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24 (hosts database services)

### Frontend & Load Balancing
- **Azure Front Door**: Global load balancer and CDN
  - Provides SSL termination
  - Global traffic routing
  - DDoS protection
- **Application Gateway**: Regional load balancer
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - SSL offloading
  - Path-based routing

### Compute Layer
- **App Service**: 
  - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
  - Auto-scaling capabilities
  - Deployment slots for blue-green deployments
  - Managed runtime environment

### Data Layer
- **Azure SQL Database**:
  - Managed SQL database service
  - Automatic backups and point-in-time restore
  - High availability with 99.99% SLA
  - Advanced security features

### Storage & Security
- **Storage Account**:
  - Blob storage for static content
  - File shares for application data
  - Queue storage for async processing
- **Key Vault**:
  - Centralized secrets management
  - Certificate management
  - Encryption key management

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Application Insights**:
  - Application performance monitoring (APM)
  - Real-time telemetry
  - Custom dashboards and alerts
- **Log Analytics Workspace**:
  - Centralized logging
  - Log queries and analysis
  - Integration with Azure Monitor

## Data Flow
1. User requests → Azure Front Door → Application Gateway
2. Application Gateway → App Service (in Web Subnet)
3. App Service → SQL Database (in Database Subnet)
4. App Service → Storage Account (for static content)
5. App Service → Key Vault (for secrets/certificates)
6. All services → Application Insights (telemetry)
7. All services → Log Analytics (logs)

## Security Features
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) on subnets
- Azure Active Directory integration
- SSL/TLS encryption in transit
- Data encryption at rest
- Private endpoints for database connectivity
- Managed identities for service-to-service authentication

## Scalability Features
- Auto-scaling for App Service
- Azure SQL Database elastic pools
- CDN for global content distribution
- Load balancing across multiple instances

## Compliance & Governance
- Azure Policy for governance
- Resource tagging for cost management
- RBAC for access control
- Azure Security Center recommendations
