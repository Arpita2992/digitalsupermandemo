AWS Architecture Diagram

This diagram shows an AWS-based web application architecture:

Components:
- EC2 instances (t3.medium) in us-east-1
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Amazon RDS MySQL database
- S3 bucket for static assets
- CloudFront CDN
- Lambda functions for API processing
- API Gateway for REST endpoints
- DynamoDB for session storage
- ElastiCache Redis cluster

Network Configuration:
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway for outbound traffic
- Security Groups for traffic control

This is clearly an Amazon Web Services architecture with no Azure components.
