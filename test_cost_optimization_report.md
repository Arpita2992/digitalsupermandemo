## Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. VM web-server: Changed size from Standard_D4s_v3 to Standard_B2s for development environment
2. App Service Plan app-service-plan: Changed from P1V2 to B1 for development environment
3. SQL Database sql-database: Changed from S2 to Basic for development environment

## AI-Powered Strategic Insights

• Implement auto-shutdown for development resources
• Consider using Azure Dev/Test pricing
• Set up cost monitoring and alerts

## Estimated Cost Savings Breakdown

• **web-server** (vm_rightsizing): €50-150/month
• **app-service-plan** (app_service_optimization): €30-100/month

## Key Optimization Areas

• Resource right-sizing
• Environment-specific configurations
• Auto-scaling and automation

## Microsoft Well-Architected Framework Compliance

This optimization follows the five key principles of cost optimization:
• **Plan and estimate costs** - Detailed cost analysis and estimation
• **Provision with optimization** - Right-sized resources for environment
• **Use monitoring and analytics** - Recommendations for cost monitoring
• **Maximize efficiency** - Auto-scaling and automation recommendations
• **Optimize over time** - Continuous optimization roadmap

## Important Notes

• Cost savings estimates are approximate and may vary based on actual usage
• Implement changes in non-production environments first
• Monitor performance impact after implementing optimizations
• Review and update optimizations regularly as usage patterns change
